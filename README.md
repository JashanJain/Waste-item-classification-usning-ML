# Waste-item-classification-usning-ML
This project is a waste item classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and VGG16. It classifies waste into 9 broad categories using a dataset from Kaggle containing over 8000 images.

Technologies Used

CNN & VGG16 - Deep learning models for image classification

Python - Programming language

TensorFlow/Keras - Frameworks for deep learning

Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle and consists of more than 8000 labeled images of waste items.
